Code Analysis
=============

Part 1)
The data we recieved from running cuda.sh is below. Effective bandwidth is being calculated on this line of code in naive.cu:
	double bw = (N * sizeof(dtype)) / (t_kernel_0 * 1e9);
`N` is the size of the data, `dtype` is the datatype and it is divided by `t_kernel_0` which is the time to execute the naive GPU reduction kernel * 1000000000.
